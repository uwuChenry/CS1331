the audio path for javafx is very picky for some reason, the app is running in CS1331/src/JungeonJrawler.java
both the audio files and images are placed together in the /src folder
but for some reason the audio path needs to be "src/audioName.wav" and not just "audioName.wav" (like the image)

Repository Structure:
- CS1331 (main folder)
  - javafxsdk folder (contains the JavaFX SDK libraries needed to run the game)
  - src folder (contains all source code and resources)
    - JungeonJrawler.java (main game class)
    - Backend.java (game logic and collision detection)
    - Image resources (monster.png, welcomeImage.png, etc.)
    - Audio files (welcome.wav, hurt.wav, fight.wav, win.wav, lose.wav, etc.)
